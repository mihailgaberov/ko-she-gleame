# What shall we watch tonight

A small app, built with React and Vite. It consumes IMDb movies API so that an user can pick a movie to watch. The movie selection can be done
by examining the most popular movies or by using built-in functionality 'Feeling lucky', which is picking randomly a movie from a pre-defined
(say from 1-1000) list with popular movies.
